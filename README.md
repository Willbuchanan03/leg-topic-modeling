# leg-topic-modeling
Repository Containing Legislative Identificaiton and Data Fetching Tools

For the Initial Topic Modeling Program:

This program may take four or more hours to run through from scratch. However, it is set up such that succesive runs of the program should take less than a minute, given that it only has to pull and parse from .txt instead of grooming and cleaning API queries. If you are changing the search range of congresses you are using, you will need to delete any .txt files from the folder they are being stored in and generate new ones. If you are only changing the selected references, you do not have to generate new .txt files. The same goes for any other content changes you might be making that don't directly impact the requests made for documents from the congressional API.
